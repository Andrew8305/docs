# OIDC-conformant Passwordless Authentication

<%= include('./tutorials/adoption/_about.md') %>

Auth0 currently only supports an [OIDC-conformant](/api-auth/tutorials/adoption) passwordless authentication mechanism using the Auth0-hosted login page.

We plan on implementing OIDC-conformant passwordless authentication mechanism for embedded login scenarios in future releases.
