# OIDC-conformant Passwordless Authentication

<%= include('./tutorials/adoption/_about.md') %>

Auth0 currently only supports an [OIDC-conformant](/api-auth/tutorials/adoption) passwordless authentication mechanism when using web clients (with Lock.js or auth0.js).

Native applications need to use centralized login (with Auth0-hosted login page). Customers can use the Lock (Passwordless) template in Dashboard under Hosted Pages -> Default Templates, or customize it to fit specific requirements.
